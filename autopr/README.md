It includes actions for various tasks, a GitHub Actions workflow entry point, logging configuration, main service implementation, data models, services for managing automated actions, trigger configurations, and workflows for handling tasks like workflow configuration management and repository updates. These files collectively provide a framework for defining, automating, and managing complex workflows within a Python application efficiently.


### [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/__init__.py)

This file is empty.  


### [`actions/`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/actions)

This folder contains a collection of Python files that define reusable actions for various tasks in an autonomous agent system. Each file represents a specific action, such as running bash commands, generating choices for user prompts, publishing comments on GitHub, committing and pushing changes to a remote repository, and more. These files provide modular and configurable functionalities that can be utilized independently or combined to automate complex workflows within the system.  


### [`gh_actions_entrypoint.py`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/gh_actions_entrypoint.py)

📄 This file is the entry point for a GitHub Actions workflow.   
🔧 It contains the main logic for running the workflow.  
🔒 It retrieves settings and authentication tokens from environment variables.  
📥 It loads and parses the event data from a JSON file.  
🚀 It initializes and runs the main service for the GitHub Actions workflow.  
📝 It uses classes and methods from the "autopr" module to handle the workflow.  
⚙️ The purpose of this file is to orchestrate the execution of the workflow.  
🔗 It connects different services, such as the platform service and the publish service.  
🔄 It interacts with the GitHub API to perform actions on the repository.  
🔒 The GitHub token is used for authentication and authorization.  


### [`log_config.py`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/log_config.py)

📝 This file is used to configure logging settings and create loggers.   
🔧 It imports the necessary modules for logging and structlog.   
🔒 The logging level is set to DEBUG.   
🎨 If the "pretty" flag is True, additional processors are added for log level, exception info, and console rendering with colors.   
🔧 Otherwise, no processors are added.   
🔧 The structlog is configured with the chosen processors and the logger is cached on first use.   
📝 The file also includes a function to get a logger instance.   
🔧 The configure_logging function is called to configure logging on module import.  


### [`main.py`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/main.py)

📋 This file contains the implementation of the `MainService` class, which serves as the main entry point for the application.   
🔧 It initializes various services and handles the execution of triggers and workflows.  
📦 It also defines the `Settings` class for storing configuration settings.  
🔍 The `MainService` class retrieves repository information, creates necessary services, and runs triggers based on events.  
✨ Triggers are defined in the `triggers` module, and workflows are defined in the `workflows` module.  
🚀 The `run` method of the `MainService` class triggers the event and executes the associated workflows.  
🌐 The platform-specific functionality is encapsulated in the `PlatformService` class.  
💻 The `ActionService` class handles actions to be performed based on triggers.  
📝 The `CommitService` class manages commits to the repository.  
🔗 The `TriggerService` class handles the interaction between triggers, workflows, and the commit service.  


### [`models/`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/models)

This folder contains Python files that define data models for messages, threads, issues, and pull requests, as well as classes and functions for building and executing customizable workflows with strict validation and transformation of variables. Additionally, it defines classes related to events in the AutoPR system and types and classes for context variables, templates, and executables in a workflow automation system. Overall, these files provide a framework for defining, automating, and managing complex workflows and processes within a Python application.  


### [`services/`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/services)

This folder contains Python modules for managing automated actions in a pull request workflow. It includes classes for services like ActionService for running actions, CacheService for caching data, CommitService for managing Git commits, and PlatformService for interacting with platforms like GitHub. Other services handle triggers, publishing updates, applying and getting diffs, and executing workflows based on specified actions. These modules work together to automate and manage various aspects of a pull request workflow efficiently.  


### [`triggers.py`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/triggers.py)

📄 This file defines a function called `get_all_triggers`.  
📂 It imports necessary modules and classes.  
💡 The purpose of this function is to retrieve all trigger configurations from specified files.  
🗂️ It searches for trigger configurations in a given directory.  
🔍 The function looks for trigger configurations in both YAML and YML file formats.  
📝 It reads the contents of the trigger configuration files.  
🧪 The function validates and parses the trigger configurations using Pydantic.  
🔀 It extracts the triggers from the parsed configurations.  
🔄 The function returns a list of all triggers found in the trigger configuration files.  
📥 The function takes optional parameters for the configuration directory and repository path.  


### [`workflows/`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/workflows)

This folder contains Python scripts and YAML files that define workflows for handling various tasks such as collecting and loading workflow configurations, making API calls, summarizing files and folders, inserting content into files, managing TODOs in code repositories, and summarizing changes in pull requests. These scripts and files automate processes like workflow configuration management, file manipulation, repository updates, issue tracking, and pull request summarization, providing a structured and efficient way to handle these tasks in a development environment.
