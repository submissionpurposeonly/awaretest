## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains Python scripts and YAML files that define workflows for handling various tasks such as collecting and loading workflow configurations, making API calls, summarizing files and folders, inserting content into files, managing TODOs in code repositories, and summarizing changes in pull requests. These scripts and files automate processes like workflow configuration management, file manipulation, repository updates, issue tracking, and pull request summarization, providing a structured and efficient way to handle these tasks in a development environment.


### [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/workflows/__init__.py)

📝 This file contains a Python script.  
🛠️ The purpose of the script is to collect and load workflow configurations from YAML files.  
📂 It recursively searches for YAML files in a specified folder and its subfolders.  
📝 The collected workflows are stored in a `TopLevelWorkflowConfig` object.  
⚠️ It handles exceptions and logs errors if there are any issues with loading or validating the workflows.  
🔄 It can also load additional test workflows if provided.  
📥 The loaded workflows are returned as the result of the `get_all_workflows()` function.  
📥 The script can be run as a standalone program to print the loaded workflows.  
📂 The script relies on other modules and classes imported at the beginning of the file.  
🚀 The script can be extended or modified to fit specific workflow configuration needs.  


### [`api_git_history.yaml`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/workflows/api_git_history.yaml)

📝 This file defines a set of steps for making an API call, saving the response to a file, and committing and pushing the file to a git repository.  
🔗 The API call endpoint URL, headers, and filepath are defined as inputs.  
🔀 The file uses a "make_api_call" action to make a GET request to the specified endpoint URL, using the provided headers.  
📄 The response content is then saved into a file specified by the filepath input, overwriting any existing content in the file.  
📦 Finally, the file is committed and pushed to a git repository, with a commit message template that includes the endpoint URL and filepath.  


### [`autogenerate_readmes.yaml`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/workflows/autogenerate_readmes.yaml)

📝 This file contains a YAML structure defining workflows for summarizing files and folders, generating README summaries, and committing and pushing changes to a repository.    
🔍 The main workflows include `summarize_file`, `summarize_folder`, and `generate_summary`.    
📂 It involves actions like reading files, prompting for summaries, and listing folder contents.    
📄 The workflows aim to generate living summaries for files and folders, updating README files with formatted summaries.    
🔄 It includes steps for handling empty files and folders, generating summaries based on file contents, and structuring README summaries.    


### [`insert_into_readme.yaml`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/workflows/insert_into_readme.yaml)

📝 This file defines a task called "insert_into_readme" that inserts content into a file between two HTML-style comments.  
📂 The file path, tag name, and content to insert are specified as inputs.  
💾 The task reads the file, inserts the content between the specified comments, and then writes the modified content back into the file.  
📥 If the file does not exist, it will be created.  
📑 If only one comment is found, the content will be appended to the end of the file.  
🖋️ The task uses three actions: "read_file" to read the file, "insert_content_into_text" to insert the content, and "write_into_file" to write the modified content.  
📄 The output of the task is the content of the file after the insertion.  
✅ The task returns a success flag indicating whether the write operation was successful.  


### [`list_and_publish_todos.yaml`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/workflows/list_and_publish_todos.yaml)

📝 This file defines workflows for managing TODOs in code repositories.    
🔍 It includes tasks like finding TODOs, building issue titles, and publishing issues.    
🔧 Workflows involve setting variables, iterating through TODOs, and prompting for descriptions.    
🛠️ It supports creating issues with titles, bodies, labels, and numbers based on the TODOs.    
📋 The main workflow 'publish_todo_issues' updates and manages TODO issues.    


### [`summarize_pr.yaml`](https://github.com/submissionpurposeonly/awaretest/blob/7827ac89c146b063711453fd33b36658f1ad4ab0/./autopr/workflows/summarize_pr.yaml)

📝 This file defines a workflow called `summarize_pr` that summarizes the changes in a pull request.  
🔍 It uses the `git diff` command to get the difference between the base commit and the pull request.  
💬 It prompts the user to summarize the changes using markdown and emojis to highlight the contents of the changes.  
💡 The user's input is stored in the `summary` variable.  
💬 The summarized changes are then posted as a comment.
